I attended the [ENAR meeting](http://www.enar.org/meetings.cfm) in Orlando, Florida, last week. ([ENAR](http://www.enar.org) = "Eastern North American Region" of the [International Biometric Society](http://www.biometricsociety.org).)

I had a great time, but I did come to the strong realization that what I view as important is distinctly different from what the typical ENAR attendee views as important.  ([Rafa](http://www.rafalab.org) said, incredulously, "You knew that already!")

Let me tell you about the high- and lowlights, for me.

Also see the ENAR-related comments from [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/en/2013/03/on-enar-or-statistical-meetings-in-general/) and [Alyssa Frazee](http://alyssafrazee.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/ideas-for-super-awesome-conferences/).

### Highlights

  * Getting to know [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name), and the introductory part of his talk on [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/).

  * Having lunch with [Hopkins Biostat](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) students.

  * Twittering, particularly with [@StrictlyStat](http://twitter.com/StrictlyStat) and [@hspter](http://twitter.com/hspter).

  * Hadley Wickham's [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org) tutorial, in which I really learned how to teach.  (Can I put it into practice?)

  * [Matthew Stephens](http://genes.uchicago.edu/contents/faculty/stephens-matthew.html)'s talk, and spending time with him.

  * [Jeff Morris](http://faculty.mdanderson.org/Jeffrey_Morris/Default.asp)'s orientation to Epcot.

  * The large data visualization session, with [John](http://twitter.com/StrictlyStat), [Hadley](http://had.co.nz), [Amy Heineke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdwJvQXeg4), and [me](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman).  (Thanks, [Bruce](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~bswihart/)!)

### Lowlights

  * They should have emphasized the cheaper shuttle from the airport (vs taxi); the information was hard to find.

  * They should have emphasized that wifi was actually free; ignore the \$14.95/day charge as it gets waived from your bill.

  * Registration on Sunday closed early, so many at the poster session were without name badges.

  * The program guide PDF should have had bookmarks, and the schedule should have included links to the abstracts.

  * Realism regarding the start time for the President's invited address.  But I guess if we knew the awards ceremony would take not 15 min but 45, _everyone_ would skipped.

  * The venue was too isolated.

  * The hotel was too expensive.

  * The \$85 admission to Epcot was a required part of the registration fee (23%).  The registration fee (\$365) was the same as for ENAR 2012 in Washington DC, but it could have been \$280.  And there's a striking difference between "It's free!" and "You already paid for it!"

  * The lighting in meeting rooms was not great.  We needed a ladder and a can of spray paint to "turn off" those lights shining on the screen.

As I said at the beginning, I had a good time. But I worry particularly about accessibility to students paying their own way.

It was a really useful and inspirational meeting, right up there with the [UseR 2011 meeting](http://kbroman.org/blog/2011/08/20/user-conference-2011-highlights/) in the UK, but less from talks and more from individual interactions.
